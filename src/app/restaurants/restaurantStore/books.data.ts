      name: 'Don Quixote',
      author: 'Miguel de Cervantes',
      price: 54,
      genres: ['Novel'],
      description:
        'Cervantes tale of the deranged gentleman who turns knight-errant, tilts at windmills and battles with sheep in the service of the lady of his dreams, Dulcinea del Toboso, has fascinated generations of readers, and inspired other creative artists such as Flaubert, Picasso and Richard Strauss. The tall, thin knight and his short, fat squire, Sancho Panza, have found their way into films, cartoons and even computer games. Supposedly intended as a parody of the most popular escapist fiction of the day, the books of chivalry , this precursor of the modern novel broadened and deepened into a sophisticated, comic account of the contradictions of human nature. On his heroic journey Don Quixote meets characters of every class and condition, from the prostitute Maritornes, who is commended for her Christian charity, to the Knight of the Green Coat, who seems to embody some of the constraints of virtue.'

      name: 'Great Expectations',
      author: 'Charles Dickens',
      price: 300,
      genres: ['Novel'],
      description: `Pip, a poor orphan being raised by a cruel sister, does not have much in the way of great expectations—until he is inexplicably elevated to wealth by an anonymous benefactor. Full of unforgettable characters—including a terrifying convict named Magwitch, the eccentric Miss Havisham, and her beautiful but manipulative niece, Estella, Great Expectations is a tale of intrigue, unattainable love, and all of the happiness money can’t buy. 'Great Expectations has the most wonderful and most perfectly worked-out plot for a novel in the English language,' according to John Irving, and J. Hillis Miller declares, 'Great Expectations is the most unified and concentrated expression of Dickens’s abiding sense of the world, and Pip might be called the archetypal Dickens hero.`
